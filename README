Eagle Eye 0.0.1

Introduction
------------

Eagle Eye cycles through a list of URLs, displaying them at
regular intervals.  This is useful for monitoring a set of web
pages, for example from network and system monitoring packages
like Nagios.

Requirements
------------

Eagle Eye depends on GTK+ 2.0, WebKit-GTK 1.0, and libsoup 2.4.
WebKit-GTK in particular is a fast moving target; I've personally
built Eagle Eye successfully using version 1.1.15, but earlier or
later versions will likely work.

If you're building from a cloned git repository instead of a
packaged release tarball, then you will also need autoconf 2.59
and automake 1.7.

Installation
------------

Comprehensive installation instructions are detailed in the
INSTALL file located in the top-level directory.  For a quick
start:

$ ./bootstrap.sh   (if building from git)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

To remove Eagle Eye:

$ make uninstall

BUGS
----

Probably lots.
